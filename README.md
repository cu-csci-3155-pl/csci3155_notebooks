# Readings and In-Class Lecture Notes for CSCI 3155
## Sriram Sankaranarayanan (Computer Science, CU Boulder)
This repository contains the jupyter scala notebooks for Principles of Programming: CSCI 3155, University of Colorado Boulder. The repository also contains the jupyter notebooks with examples that were used during lectures.

### Instructions

- Regularly use git pull to keep yourself up to date with the repo.
- The repository mirrors information already posted on our canvas. This will be updated in a more lazy manner. In a pinch, please see canvas.


## Sources and Credits

The notebooks form the official "textbook" for this class.  [Sriram Sankaranarayanan](http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~srirams) is the author of these notebooks, and takes full responsibility/blame for their contents. The **original** goal of these notes was to translate the wonderful book:
__Essentials of Programming Languages__ by Friedman and Wand
into the Scala language used in our class as lecture notes. However, the notes have evolved and so has their distance from
Friedman and Wand's textbook. In particular, the notation used,
the way concepts have been presented and the order of presentation have all significantly deviated from the book at this point. Nevertheless, the original inspiration for these notes is gratefully acknowledged.

Sriram is grateful to Prof. Bor-Yuh Evan Chang for providing structure and designing this class. These lecture notes also owe a debt to Prof. Chang's own notes.

Spencer Wilson contributed comments/critique and many of the in class notebooks.

The notebooks have evolved thanks to comments by current and past TAs including Albert Dayn, David Moon, Kyle Headley, Jack Martin, Monal Narasimhamurthy, and Rohit Mehra. Many students contributed typo fixes and suggestions.

## How to view these notebooks

Students registered in the class can use the official CSCI Virtual Machine. Setup instructions for Jupyter notebook and the scala kernel are provided.

If you do not have access to these VMs, please install jupyter notebook, scala IDEs (including compiler, scala build tools) and the Almond kernel for
scala: https://github.com/almond-sh/almond.
It works well with Java 1.8 and 1.11 (the stable versions for the JDK). However, we have made it work for other Java versions with careful choice of the almond kernel, sbt and scala versions.


__Note:__ Although github has a viewer for these notebooks, it often cannot render some of the characters very well.  Thus, the output looks distorted with "Unknown Character"
all over the place. Cloning and viewing on your own jupyter notebook viewer is the best way.
